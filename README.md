# RevealOff

[Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) + [Showoff](https://github.com/schacon/showoff)

# Usage

1. Grab a copy from [BinTray](https://bintray.com/matschaffer/generic/revealoff)
2. Unzip
3. Run ./bin/revealoff

This will start a server on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) displaying the content of `slides.md`.

Use `!SLIDE` to separate slides.

# Notice

This is hot off the presses and lots of changes are planned so I wouldn't go building a whole corpus of slide decks with this just yet.
